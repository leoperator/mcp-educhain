generate 2 python mcqs using educhain

I'll generate 2 Python multiple-choice questions using the EduChain tool.Egenerate_mcqsRequest{
  `topic`: `Python programming`,
  `num_questions`: 2
}Response{
  "question": "What is the correct way to create a function in Python?",
  "options": [
    "function my_function():",
    "def my_function():",
    "create my_function():",
    "define my_function()"
  ],
  "answer": "def my_function():",
  "explanation": "In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parentheses."
}Response{
  "question": "Which of the following is a mutable data type in Python?",
  "options": [
    "tuple",
    "list",
    "string",
    "int"
  ],
  "answer": "list",
  "explanation": "Lists in Python can be changed after their creation, making them mutable, while tuples are immutable."
}Here are 2 Python MCQs generated using EduChain:
Question 1:
What is the correct way to create a function in Python?
A) function my_function():
B) def my_function():
C) create my_function():
D) define my_function()
Answer: B) def my_function():
Explanation: In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.

Question 2:
Which of the following is a mutable data type in Python?
A) tuple
B) list
C) string
D) int
Answer: B) list
Explanation: Lists in Python can be changed after their creation, making them mutable, while tuples are immutable.
